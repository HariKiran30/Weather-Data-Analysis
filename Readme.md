- Checking if there are any null values and droping them
- To find unique instances of weather types
- find all records from data of when the weather was exactly clear

- find the variance of pressure
- find the days on which wind speed was less than or equal to 30 km/hr and temperature was greater than 0 C
- To find the date and temperatures for all instances when snow was recorded
- Created Plots
